(1) Measurement Indexers start off with "String" parametric type (for looking up raw data tags)

(2) Instantiation comes with new data
     -  Raw measurements
     -  Local thermodynamic optimizations (i.e. specific volume)
     -  Internal instantiated expressions 
            stream = instantiate(streamind, x::AbstractVector)
            err = y - f(stream)
     -  Generate a vector of function wrappers for innovations (z(x) = y - f(x)) (including stdev)
            This includes all of the balance innovations

(3) Optimize over function wrappers divided by stdev

(4) Use the sparse independent covariance update procedure
     -  Build an state index generator for every measurement type
     -  Sparse gradients (to obtain observation matrix C) for each measurement
     -  Only update covariance along index
